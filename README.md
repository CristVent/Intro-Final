## Intro Month - Final
This was my first project while attending my coding camp.

The general idea was to create a simple record manager that created and deleted records. 

I used this as an opportunity to further explore Bootstrap and JavaScript.

### Used
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Visual Studio Code
